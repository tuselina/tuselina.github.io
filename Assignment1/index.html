    <h1> RITWICK DEY PORTFOLIO </h1>
    <h1>Selina Tu (s3717097) </h1>
    <h2>
    Question 1
    </h2>
    <br>
    <h2>Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</h2>
<p>I first clicked on the explore me button which brought me to a list of 4 options that could be chosen. I first clicked on the portfolio as it was the first option on the top. As I hovered over the cards the square tabs would spin around and turn over to the other side. I clicked on more details, which brought a new tab to pop up on the right. I clicked on the link on the top which brought me into a new tab. I returned to the original page and clicked on the cross button to exit the tab. I hovered over all the cards to view their descriptions on the back of the cards. In the portfolio tab I clicked on all the subheadings. I clicked on tabs on the tabs on the top on the main page as it was easy access. There was a lot of going back and forth between the main page to go through all the different pages. </p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>
Question 2
</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>
<p>
    The first thing I paid attention to was that the features on this website are very responsive/reactive and sensitive to mouse movement. There is a lot of movement as soon as I enter the website the content slides into the frame and buttons and photos move and expand in a hierarchy pattern. The picture pops up first following with the text and the buttons. 
    The explore me button shakes which draws my attention to it along with the bright orange colour and line that extends down from it which draws the eye downwards creating anticipation and curiosity. 
    There is a contrast between the bright orange button and frame around the picture against the dark blue background. The home page is quite minimal and draws attention to the center.   
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>
    Question 3
    </h2>
        <br>
        <h2>What did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
<br>
<p>
I spent most time engaging with the portfolio page and returning back to the main home page to explore the other headings. The portfolio page holds many cards in at least 3 columns and 3 or more rows. A lot of time is spent going through each car individually reading through the details and contents of each card inside. Each card has two links and a description to go along with it. The links take me to a separate external web page. 
</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>
    Question 4
    </h2>
        <br>
    <h2>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
<br>
<p>
 My most common action was clicking on the return arrow button to go back to the main homepage and clicking on the explore me button on the homepage.  
</p>
    <br>
<br>
<h2>
    Question 5
    </h2>
        <br>
    <h2>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>
<br>
<p>
    The main primary goal of the experience was to showcase and share information on the persons identity and background. The purpose of the website is displaying the person’s skills and have access to tutorials to help people with coding. The subheadings of different categories and types of coding allows users to easily find what they are looking for. 
</p>
    <br>
<br>
<h2>
    Question 6
    </h2>
        <br>
    <h2>How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</h2>
<br>
<p>The website communicates its primary goal by laying out all the content in a clear and concise way. The content is placed under subheadings and different cards for different projects. The experience of the cards flipping over gives a sense of as if  it is revealing the behind-the-scenes tech stuff that goes on behind the project. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>
    Question 7
    </h2>
        <br>
    <h2>What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</h2>
<br>
<p>
The impression of the intended length of a single interaction is a few seconds of how long it takes for the content and features to slide into the position. All the text, photos and buttons have a visual effect of a slide transition where the text slides horizontally in and out of frame when a button is clicked. Like a slide show, the contents gradually swipe to the left when moving to the next page, at the same time the new page slides into frame from the right into the center. This gives time for the user to digest the content as the features slide in one at a time. 
I am intended to interact with the website with a purpose to find a project that I am interested in as this platform is used to connect Ritwick’s tutorials on Github website to his portfolio website. 

</p>
    <br>
<br>
<h2>
    Question 8
    </h2>
        <br>
    <h2>What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</h2>
<br>
    <p>The experience imitates a similar vibe to a business card and resume with the profile card and the about & skills tab. The cards can be interpreted as flash cards that have text on both sides that correspond to each other. The website experience is similar to an interactive slide show presentation that consistently swipes right to left horizontally across the screen. The features slide in from the right side top to bottom. 
    </p>
    <br>
<br>
<h2>
    Question 9
    </h2>
        <br>
    <h2>What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when 
        engaging with it?</h2>
<br>
    <p>
        This reference suggests the user feel compelled to learn and curious when exploring the website. The presentation style format gives a more laid-back and welcoming atmosphere whilst still being professional. 
        It is an interactive and interesting representation of a resume. This can make the audience feel as if this is a familiar territory whilst putting a twist with lots of refined visual effects. When you are familiar with a person’s background and who they are, you feel that you can trust the person’s skills and ideas, like a teacher. Then the users are able to feel that they can trust that his tutorials will be helpful. They feel safe and secure when reading through his materials. 
        </p>
    
    <br>
<br>
<h2>
    Question 10
    </h2>
        <br>
    <h2>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</h2>	
<br>
    <p>The most frustrating element is that the links bring the user to a new website tab which causes a little inconvenience when there are many links to explore. The cards on the portfolio page spin around when the mouse hovers over it, when I move to the next card beside it, both cards spin around simultaneously. It is a cool effect but it can be quite distracting when trying to read the description text on the cards due to the constant movement. There is a consistent pattern where every two pairs next to each other that is hovered over will spin together and will keep going as the mouse moves across the cards. 
There are many project tutorials in his portfolio which can be quite overwhelming at first to pick where to start exploring. Since the cards all look quite similar it can feel a bit overloaded and bombarding to go through all of the cards at once. 
        </p>
  
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>
        Question 11
        </h2>
            <br>
        <h2>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?</h2>	
    <br>
  <p>
    The most satisfying moment of the interaction was when a specific tab was selected the other tabs that weren’t selected were crossed out. 
The website is reactive when the mouse hovers over certain features they will flip as if it has been touched. There is a lot of movement and visual stimulation that keeps the website interesting and entertaining as our eyes naturally draw attention to movement.
